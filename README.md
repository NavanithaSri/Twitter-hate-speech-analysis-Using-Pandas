<h1><b>Detecting Hate Speech on Twitter with Machine Learning</b></h1>
This project focuses on analyzing hate speech on Twitter using a machine learning approach in Python. A pre-labeled CSV file is used as the dataset, containing tweet texts and their corresponding labels (e.g., Hate Speech, Offensive, Neutral). The project leverages Python's powerful data manipulation library, Pandas, for preprocessing and cleaning the data. Machine learning models are then trained to classify the tweets, providing insights into the prevalence and nature of hate speech. The analysis includes performance evaluation through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
